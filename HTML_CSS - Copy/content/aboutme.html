                                <p>As the sole student member of the technology department at my school, I took on the task of fixing both, hardware like repairing mics or webcams, and software such as restoring computers digitally. This voluntary position allowed me to problem-solve for the benefit of classmates and staff on a daily basis.

                            <li>Sierra Canyon Day Camp - Head Counselor
                                <p>Worked 5 days a week for multiple summers taking care of children from preschool to 5th grade. As a counselor, I learned the value of patience for kids, how to enforce safety rules, and how to promote interest in all recreational activities as a Leader. I volunteered unpaid for the first summer, but eventually worked my way up over time to the head counselor position. All to assist hundreds of families that needed their children to be taken care of.
